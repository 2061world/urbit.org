## 1. Get on the network

First, you’ll need to get on Urbit. You can quickly check out the network by [downloading the Port application](https://github.com/urbit/port) and booting up a comet–a temporary Urbit ID.

For long-term use, you’ll want to get a permanent Urbit ID and consider a running your urbit in the cloud or on a hosted service.

Read our [Getting Started guide](https://urbit.org/install) for details.

## 2. Open the Groups app

Once you’re on the network, you’ll see and large tiled interface with a few applications installed: Terminal, Groups, and Bitcoin. Click on Groups.

## 5. Join channels

Congratulations, if you’re seeing a window like the one that appears below then you’ve joined the group!

There two types of channels in the left column: Chats, and Notebooks. The former is self-explanatory, while the latter is like a blog with optional comments.

To join a channel within the group, select a channel name from the left column, and click the Join Channel button.
