We're still meeting up outside...and this time we're meeting at Golden Gate Park!

Please join us for a park meetup (picnic optional!) in the 'Marx Meadow' area of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, on Sunday, 5/8. We'll meet at 1:00PM and stay as long as people want to chat. Bring a jacket and your choice of food/drink.
Interested friends and the Urbit-curious are always welcome!

It's Mother's Day; if you are a mom (or bring your mom) we'd love to give you a planet!
